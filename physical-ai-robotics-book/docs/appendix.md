## Glossary

### A
*   **Actuator**: A motor or mechanism that moves a robot joint.
*   **Agent**: An AI entity that perceives its environment and takes actions.

### D
*   **Digital Twin**: A virtual replica of a physical robot, matching its kinematics, physics, and sensor properties.

### G
*   **Gazebo**: A physics simulator used to calculate gravity, collisions, and forces.

### N
*   **Node**: A single process in the ROS 2 graph that performs computation.

### P
*   **Publisher**: A node that sends data to a topic.

### R
*   **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)**: The middleware framework connecting robot components.
*   **rclpy**: The Python client library for ROS 2.

### S
*   **Service**: A synchronous request/response communication pattern in ROS 2.
*   **Subscriber**: A node that listens to data from a topic.

### T
*   **Topic**: An asynchronous data channel for streaming messages between nodes.

### U
