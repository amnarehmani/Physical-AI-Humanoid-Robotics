# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Introduction

Welcome to Module 3. In the previous module, we built a "Digital Twin" using Gazebo and Unity. Now, we will upgrade the brain.

While Gazebo is excellent for general robotics, NVIDIA Isaac™ is the industry standard for **AI-driven robotics**. It provides photorealistic simulation (Isaac Sim), hardware-accelerated perception (Isaac ROS), and advanced navigation stacks.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
1.  **Simulate** photorealistic environments in NVIDIA Isaac Sim.
2.  **Perceive** the world using hardware-accelerated Visual SLAM (Isaac ROS).
3.  **Navigate** autonomously using the Nav2 stack.

### Prerequisites

*   **Hardware**: NVIDIA RTX GPU (Required for Isaac Sim).
*   **Software**: Docker, NVIDIA Container Toolkit.
*   **Knowledge**: ROS 2 Topics and Nodes (Module 1).

### Roadmap

*   **Lesson 1**: Photorealistic Simulation. Moving from Gazebo to Omniverse.
*   **Lesson 2**: Accelerated Perception. Using the GPU for VSLAM.
*   **Lesson 3**: Navigation. Planning paths in complex environments.
