# Preface

## Welcome to the Future of Robotics

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This book is designed to bridge the gap between modern artificial intelligence and physical, embodied robots. 

In the last decade, we have seen AI conquer the digital world—mastering games, generating art, and writing code. The next frontier is the **physical world**. "Physical AI" refers to intelligent systems that can perceive, reason about, and manipulate the physical environment. Humanoid robots, with their complex kinematics and similarity to human form, represent the ultimate challenge and vessel for this intelligence.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is written for:
*   **Students** entering the field of robotics who want a modern, software-first approach.
*   **Developers** familiar with AI/ML who want to port their skills to hardware.
*   **Hobbyists** building their own digital twins and simulation environments.

## What You Will Learn

We take a "Simulation-First" approach. Before breaking expensive hardware, you will learn to build robust **Digital Twins**.

*   **Module 1**: The Nervous System (ROS 2). You will learn the middleware that connects sensors to actuators.
*   **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity). You will build high-fidelity physics simulations and visualizations.
*   **Future Modules**: We will cover Navigation, Computer Vision, and Reinforcement Learning.

## How to Use This Book

This is not just a reading assignment; it is a workbook.
1.  **Read** the concepts.
2.  **Run** the provided code blocks.
3.  **Modify** the examples to test your understanding.

We use **ROS 2 (Humble/Foxy)** as our standard framework, **Gazebo** for physics, and **Unity** for visualization.

Let's begin the journey of breathing life into metal.
