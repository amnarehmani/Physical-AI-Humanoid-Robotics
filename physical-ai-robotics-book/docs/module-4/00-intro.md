# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Welcome to the final frontier. Traditional robotics requires strict code: `move_to(x=10, y=5)`. Humans prefer natural language: "Clean up the mess."

**Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** models bridge this gap. They combine:
1.  **Vision**: Seeing the mess.
2.  **Language**: Understanding the command.
3.  **Action**: Generating the robot code to clean it.

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
1.  **Transcribe** voice commands using OpenAI Whisper.
2.  **Reason** about tasks using LLMs (GPT-4).
3.  **Execute** complex multi-step plans on your simulated robot.

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

*   **OpenAI API Key**: Required for Whisper and GPT models.
*   **Python Libraries**: `openai`, `langchain`, `pyaudio`.
*   **Module 3 Completion**: We need the Nav2 stack to execute movement.

<h3>Roadmap</h3>

*   **Lesson 1**: Voice. Giving the robot an ear.
*   **Lesson 2**: Cognition. Building the planner.
*   **Lesson 3**: Capstone. Putting it all together.
