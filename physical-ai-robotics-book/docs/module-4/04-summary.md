# Module 4 Summary: The Future

You have completed the journey from basic nodes to advanced cognitive robotics.

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

1.  **Multimodal AI**: Combining Audio (Whisper), Text (LLM), and Vision (Isaac ROS) creates powerful agents.
2.  **Grounding**: The most important part of VLA is ensuring the LLM knows the physical limits and valid locations of the robot.
3.  **Modularity**: By keeping the Voice, Brain, and Body separate (via ROS topics), we can upgrade any part (e.g., switch GPT-4 to Llama 3) without breaking the robot.

<h2>The Road Ahead</h2>

This is just the beginning. The field of **Physical AI** is exploding.
- **End-to-End Models**: Google RT-2 and similar models combine vision and action into a single neural network.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Teaching robots to walk and grasp by trial and error in simulation (Isaac Lab).

Keep building. Keep simulating.
